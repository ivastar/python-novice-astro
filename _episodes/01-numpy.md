In this episode we will learn how to work with supenovae lightcurve data in Python. However,
before we discuss how to deal with many data points, let's learn how to work with
single data values.

## Variables

Any Python interpreter can be used as a calculator:
~~~
3 + 5 * 4
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
23
~~~
{: .output}

This is great but not very interesting.
To do anything useful with data, we need to assign its value to a _variable_.
In Python, we can [assign]({{ page.root }}/reference/#assign) a value to a
[variable]({{ page.root }}/reference/#variable), using the equals sign `=`.
For example, to assign value `60` to a variable `weight_kg`, we would execute:

~~~
weight_kg = 60
~~~
{: .language-python}

From now on, whenever we use `weight_kg`, Python will substitute the value we assigned to
it. In essence, **a variable is just a name for a value**.

In Python, variable names:

 - can include letters, digits, and underscores
 - cannot start with a digit
 - are [case sensitive]({{ page.root }}/reference/#case-sensitive).

This means that, for example:
 - `weight0` is a valid variable name, whereas `0weight` is not
 - `weight` and `Weight` are different variables

## Types of data
Python knows various types of data. Three common ones are:

* integer numbers
* floating point numbers, and
* strings.

In the example above, variable `weight_kg` has an integer value of `60`.
To create a variable with a floating point value, we can execute:

~~~
weight_kg = 60.0
~~~
{: .language-python}

And to create a string we simply have to add single or double quotes around some text, for example:

~~~
weight_kg_text = 'weight in kilograms:'
~~~
{: .language-python}

## Using Variables in Python
To display the value of a variable to the screen in Python, we can use the `print` function:

~~~
print(weight_kg)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
60.0
~~~
{: .output}

We can display multiple things at once using only one `print` command:

~~~
print(weight_kg_text, weight_kg)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
weight in kilograms: 60.0
~~~
{: .output}

Moreover, we can do arithmetics with variables right inside the `print` function:

~~~
print('weight in pounds:', 2.2 * weight_kg)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
weight in pounds: 132.0
~~~
{: .output}

The above command, however, did not change the value of `weight_kg`:
~~~
print(weight_kg)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
60.0
~~~
{: .output}

To change the value of the `weight_kg` variable, we have to
**assign** `weight_kg` a new value using the equals `=` sign:

~~~
weight_kg = 65.0
print('weight in kilograms is now:', weight_kg)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
weight in kilograms is now: 65.0
~~~
{: .output}

Words are useful, but what's more useful are the sentences and stories we build with them.
Similarly, while a lot of powerful, general tools are built into Python,
specialized tools built up from these basic units live in
[libraries]({{ page.root }}/reference/#library)
that can be called upon when needed.

## Loading data into Python
In order to load our supernova data, we need to access
([import]({{ page.root }}/reference/#import) in Python terminology) a library called
[NumPy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/ "NumPy Documentation").  In general you should use this
library if you want to do fancy things with numbers, especially if you have matrices or arrays.  We
can import NumPy using:

~~~
import numpy
~~~
{: .language-python}

Importing a library is like getting a piece of lab equipment out of a storage locker and setting it
up on the bench. Libraries provide additional functionality to the basic Python package, much like
a new piece of equipment adds functionality to a lab space. Just like in the lab, importing too
many libraries can sometimes complicate and slow down your programs - so we only import what we
need for each program. Once we've imported the library, we can ask the library to read our data
file for us:

~~~
numpy.loadtxt(fname='data/03D1ar.csv', delimiter=',', skiprows=1)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
array([[ 5.28805e+04,  1.30350e+01,  5.42460e+00,          nan,
                 nan,          nan,          nan,          nan,
                 nan],
       [ 5.28815e+04,          nan,          nan,  7.02820e+00,
         9.91050e+00,  1.61570e+01,  1.86290e+01,  2.20860e+01,
         7.19510e+01],
         ...,
       [ 5.30262e+04,          nan,          nan,          nan,
                 nan,  5.10690e+01,  2.02770e+01,          nan,
                 nan],
       [ 5.30263e+04,          nan,          nan,  6.58160e+00,
         1.16650e+01,          nan,          nan,          nan,
                 nan]])
~~~
{: .output}

The expression `numpy.loadtxt(...)` is a [function call]({{ page.root }}/reference/#function-call)
that asks Python to run the [function]({{ page.root }}/reference/#function) `loadtxt` which
belongs to the `numpy` library. This [dotted notation]({{ page.root }}/reference/#dotted-notation)
is used everywhere in Python: the thing that appears before the dot contains the thing that
appears after.

As an example, John Smith is the John that belongs to the Smith family.
We could use the dot notation to write his name `smith.john`,
just as `loadtxt` is a function that belongs to the `numpy` library.

`numpy.loadtxt` has three [parameters]({{ page.root }}/reference/#parameter): the name of the file
we want to read, the [delimiter]({{ page.root }}/reference/#delimiter) that separates values on
a line and a statement to skip the first row. The first two need to be character strings 
(or [strings]({{ page.root }}/reference/#string)
for short), so we put them in quotes. The last one is an integer and we do not use quotes.

Since we haven't told it to do anything else with the function's output,
the terminal/notebook displays it.
In this case,
that output is the data we just loaded.
By default,
only a few rows and columns are shown
(with `...` to omit elements when displaying big arrays).
To save space,
Python displays numbers as `1.` instead of `1.0`
when there's nothing interesting after the decimal point.

Our call to `numpy.loadtxt` read our file
but didn't save the data in memory.
To do that,
we need to assign the array to a variable. Just as we can assign a single value to a variable, we
can also assign an array of values to a variable using the same syntax.  Let's re-run
`numpy.loadtxt` and save the returned data:

~~~
data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='data/03D1a1.csv', delimiter=',', skiprows=1)
~~~
{: .language-python}

This statement doesn't produce any output because we've assigned the output to the variable `data`.
If we want to check that the data have been loaded,
we can print the variable's value:

~~~
print(data)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
       ([[ 5.28805e+04,  1.30350e+01,  5.42460e+00,          nan,
                 nan,          nan,          nan,          nan,
                 nan],
       [ 5.28815e+04,          nan,          nan,  7.02820e+00,
         9.91050e+00,  1.61570e+01,  1.86290e+01,  2.20860e+01,
         7.19510e+01],
         ...,
       [ 5.30262e+04,          nan,          nan,          nan,
                 nan,  5.10690e+01,  2.02770e+01,          nan,
                 nan],
       [ 5.30263e+04,          nan,          nan,  6.58160e+00,
         1.16650e+01,          nan,          nan,          nan,
                 nan]])
~~~
{: .output}

Now that the data are in memory,
we can manipulate them.
First,
let's ask what [type]({{ page.root }}/reference/#type) of thing `data` refers to:

~~~
print(type(data))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<class 'numpy.ndarray'>
~~~
{: .output}

The output tells us that `data` currently refers to
an N-dimensional array, the functionality for which is provided by the NumPy library.
These data correspond to the fluxes of a supernova as a function of time.
The rows are the days of the observations, and the columns
the brightness measurements.

{: .callout}

With the following command, we can see the array's [shape]({{ page.root }}/reference/#shape):

~~~
print(data.shape)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
(48, 9)
~~~
{: .output}

The output tells us that the `data` array variable contains 48 rows and 9 columns. When we
created the variable `data` to store our data, we didn't just create the array; we also
created information about the array, called [members]({{ page.root }}/reference/#member) or
attributes. This extra information describes `data` in the same way an adjective describes a noun.
`data.shape` is an attribute of `data` which describes the dimensions of `data`. We use the same
dotted notation for the attributes of variables that we use for the functions in libraries because
they have the same part-and-whole relationship.

If we want to get a single number from the array, we must provide an
[index]({{ page.root }}/reference/#index) in square brackets after the variable name, just as we
do in math when referring to an element of a matrix.  Our supernova data has two dimensions, so
we will need to use two indices to refer to one specific value:

~~~
print('first value in data:', data[0, 0])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
first value in data: 52880.5
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
print('middle value in data:', data[24,5])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
middle value in data: 162.78
~~~
{: .output}

The expression `data[24,5]` accesses the element at row 24, column 5. While this expression may
not surprise you,
 `data[0, 0]` might.
Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB and R start counting at 1
because that's what human beings have done for thousands of years.
Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0
because it represents an offset from the first value in the array (the second
value is offset by one index from the first value). This is closer to the way
that computers represent arrays (if you are interested in the historical
reasons behind counting indices from zero, you can read
[Mike Hoye's blog post](http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2013/10/22/citation-needed/)).
As a result,
if we have an M×N array in Python,
its indices go from 0 to M-1 on the first axis
and 0 to N-1 on the second.
It takes a bit of getting used to,
but one way to remember the rule is that
the index is how many steps we have to take from the start to get the item we want.

{: .callout}

## Slicing data
An index like `[24,5]` selects a single element of an array,
but we can select whole sections as well.
For example,
we can select the first ten days (columns) of values
for the first four patients (rows) like this:

~~~
print(data[0:4, 0:9])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[[5.28805e+04, 1.30350e+01, 5.42460e+00,         nan,         nan,
                nan,         nan,         nan,         nan],
       [5.28815e+04,         nan,         nan, 7.02820e+00, 9.91050e+00,
        1.61570e+01, 1.86290e+01, 2.20860e+01, 7.19510e+01],
       [5.28866e+04,         nan,         nan,         nan,         nan,
        1.89440e+02, 1.98550e+01,         nan,         nan],
       [5.29005e+04, 1.42800e+02, 1.49700e+01, 4.57050e+02, 1.69190e+01,
        6.54020e+02, 2.32020e+01, 5.72040e+02, 8.95940e+01]]
~~~
{: .output}

The [slice]({{ page.root }}/reference/#slice) `0:4` means, "Start at index 0 and go up to, but not
including, index 4."Again, the up-to-but-not-including takes a bit of getting used to, but the
rule is that the difference between the upper and lower bounds is the number of values in the slice.

We don't have to start slices at 0:

~~~
print(data[5:10, 0:9])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[[5.29046e+04, 1.14730e+02, 7.55460e+00,         nan,         nan,
                nan,         nan,         nan,         nan],
       [5.29085e+04, 8.49230e+01, 7.51630e+00, 3.84570e+02, 1.27970e+01,
                nan,         nan,         nan,         nan],
       [5.29086e+04,         nan,         nan,         nan,         nan,
        6.04660e+02, 2.04640e+01,         nan,         nan],
       [5.29096e+04,         nan,         nan,         nan,         nan,
                nan,         nan, 6.69740e+02, 8.09650e+01],
       [5.29124e+04,         nan,         nan,         nan,         nan,
        5.70830e+02, 1.95730e+01,         nan,         nan]]
~~~
{: .output}

We also don't have to include the upper and lower bound on the slice.  If we don't include the lower
bound, Python uses 0 by default; if we don't include the upper, the slice runs to the end of the
axis, and if we don't include either (i.e., if we just use ':' on its own), the slice includes
everything:

~~~
small = data[:3, 7:]
print('small is:')
print(small)
~~~
{: .language-python}
The above example selects rows 0 through 2 and columns 36 through to the end of the array.

~~~
small is:
[[   nan,    nan],
 [22.086, 71.951],
 [   nan,    nan]]
~~~
{: .output}

Arrays also know how to perform common mathematical operations on their values.  The simplest
operations with data are arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  When you
do such operations on arrays, the operation is done element-by-element.  Thus:

~~~
doubledata = data * 2.0
~~~
{: .language-python}

will create a new array `doubledata`
each element of which is twice the value of the corresponding element in `data`:

~~~
print('original:')
print(data[:3, 36:])
print('doubledata:')
print(doubledata[:3, 36:])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
original:
[[   nan,    nan],
 [22.086, 71.951],
 [   nan,    nan]]
doubledata:
[[    nan,     nan],
 [ 44.172, 143.902],
 [    nan,     nan]]
~~~
{: .output}

If, instead of taking an array and doing arithmetic with a single value (as above), you did the
arithmetic operation with another array of the same shape, the operation will be done on
corresponding elements of the two arrays.  Thus:

~~~
tripledata = doubledata + data
~~~
{: .language-python}

will give you an array where `tripledata[0,0]` will equal `doubledata[0,0]` plus `data[0,0]`,
and so on for all other elements of the arrays.

~~~
print('tripledata:')
print(tripledata[:3, 36:])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
tripledata:
[[    nan,     nan],
 [ 66.258, 215.853],
 [    nan,     nan]]
~~~
{: .output}

Often, we want to do more than add, subtract, multiply, and divide array elements.  NumPy knows how
to do more complex operations, too.  If we want to find the average for the g band on, for example, 
we can ask NumPy to compute `data`'s mean value:

~~~
print(numpy.mean(data[:,1])))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
nan
~~~
{: .output}

`mean` is a [function]({{ page.root }}/reference/#function) that takes
an array as an [argument]({{ page.root }}/reference/#argument). In this case we
have a lot of NaNs in the column and `mean` cannot calculate a proper value.
A sister function, `nanmean`, can ignore the NaNs:

~~~
print(numpy.nanmean(data[:,1])))
~~~
{: .language-python}

NumPy has lots of useful functions that take an array as input.
Let's use three of those functions to get some descriptive values about the dataset.
We'll also use multiple assignment,
a convenient Python feature that will enable us to do this all in one line.

~~~
maxval, minval, stdval = numpy.nanmax(data[:,1]), numpy.nanmin(data[:,1]), numpy.nanstd(data[:,1])

print('maximum flux:', maxval)
print('minimum flux:', minval)
print('standard deviation:', stdval)
~~~
{: .language-python}

Here we've assigned the return value from `numpy.max(data)` to the variable `maxval`, the value
from `numpy.min(data)` to `minval`, and so on.

~~~
maximum flux: 142.8
minimum flux: -28.9
standard deviation: 53.4821178405979
~~~
{: .output}

{: .callout}

When analyzing data, though,
we often want to look at variations in statistical values,
such as the maximum brightness per band or object
or the average brightness per band.
One way to do this is to create a new temporary array of the data we want,
then ask it to do the calculation:

~~~
Flux_r = data[:, 3] # everything on the first axis (rows), the fourth on the second axis (columns)
print('maximum flux in g band is:', numpy.nanmax(Flux_r))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
maximum flux in g band is: 457.05
~~~
{: .output}

Everything in a line of code following the '#' symbol is a
[comment]({{ page.root }}/reference/#comment) that is ignored by Python.
Comments allow programmers to leave explanatory notes for other
programmers or their future selves.

We don't actually need to store the column in a variable of its own.
Instead, we can combine the selection and the function call:

~~~
print('maximum flux in i band is:', np.nanmax(data[:,5]))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
maximum flux in i band is: 694.11
~~~
{: .output}

What if we need the maximum flux for each day in any band (as in the
next diagram on the left) or the average for band (as in the
diagram on the right)? As the diagram below shows, we want to perform the
operation across an axis:

![Operations Across Axes](../fig/python-operations-across-axes.png)

To support this functionality,
most array functions allow us to specify the axis we want to work on.
If we ask for the average across axis 0 (rows in our 2D example),
we get:

~~~
print(numpy.nanmean(data, axis=0))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[5.29537333e+04 2.70966600e+01 8.93325833e+00 8.81428870e+01
 1.79726304e+01 2.19487541e+02 2.21493182e+01 2.12659100e+02
 8.72582000e+01]
~~~
{: .output}

As a quick check,
we can ask this array what its shape is:

~~~
print(numpy.nanmean(data, axis=0).shape)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
(9,)
~~~
{: .output}

The expression `(9,)` tells us we have an N×1 vector,
so this is the average value for each column.
If we average across axis 1 (columns in our 2D example), we get:

~~~
print(numpy.nanmean(data, axis=1))
~~~
{: .language-python}

## Other Fun Numpy Features

A common task in working with arrays is to subselect all elements that satisfy a condition . In `IDL` this task is 
carried out by the `where` function which returns the indexes of the array elements that satisfy the condition which the user can then iterrate over. While
there is a [`numpy.where`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.where.html) task, Python allows
for a more elegant execution of this workflow. Python allows for a direct comparison between a numpy array and a float or integer which returns a Boolean array.

~~~
index = data[:,1] > 100
print(index)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[False False False  True False  True False False False False False False
 False False False False False False False False False False False False
 False False False False False False False False False False False False
 False False False False False False False False False False False False]
~~~
{: .output}

In arithmetic operations with Boolean arrays, the values `True` and `False` are interpreted as `1` and `0`respectively. One easy way to find out how many items satisfied the condition (i.e. how many `True` values there are in the `index` array) is to sum the index array:

~~~
numpy.sum(index)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
2
~~~
{: .output}

This Boolean array can then be used as an index:

~~~
print(data[:,1][index])
print(data[:,1][index]+200.)
print(data[:,0][index])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[142.8  114.73]
[242.8  214.73]
[52900.5 52904.6]
~~~
{: .output}

Numpy allow for the creating of empty arrays of several different types. For example to create an array of zeros:
~~~
numpy.zeros(5)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.])
~~~
{: .output}
By default the data type is `float`. Try the following two examples:

~~~
numpy.zeros(5, dtype=int)
numpy.zeros(5, dtype=bool)
~~~
{: .language-python}

Similar to `numpy.zero` are `numpy.one` which creates an array of ones, `numpy.fill` which creates an array filled with a specified value and `numpy.empy` which creats an "empty" array. On one hand `numpy.empty` does not set the array values to zero, and may therefore be marginally faster. On the other hand, it requires the user to manually set all the values in the array, and should be used with caution.

A final ``numpy`` trick is to check if a value is NaN or to find where all the NaNs are withing an array:
~~~
np.isnan(data[:,1])
~~~
{: .output}

The output is again a Boolean array.
